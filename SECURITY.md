## Supported Versions

The project is currently under development, so we only support this version(s) of etherpad-next.

## Retrocompatibility

Etherpad-next is not retrocompatible with etherpad-lite, so you will need to migrate your data to use it.

> \[!NOTE]\
> There is no compatibility yet with etherpad-lite
> 'cause we are still developing the project.
